# wolfSSL Post-Quantum Cryptography Example

This directory contains:

- server-tls-uart.c: A server application that can perform a completely
  quantum-safe TLS 1.3  connection over UART via a USB to TTL serial cable.
- client-tls-uart.c: A client application that can perform a completely
  quantum-safe TLS 1.3 connection over UART via a USB to TTL serial cable.
- wolfssl_stm32_pq: An STM32CubeIDE project that has already been configured to
  work with the applications above to do TLS 1.3 connections as both the server
  and client using KYBER_LEVEL1 KEM for key establishment.

# Prerequisites

Support for quantum-safe key establishment on STM32 platforms in STM32CubeIDE
is new and has not made it into a release as of the time of the writing of this
document.  Support will start as of release 5.3.0.

Please see README.md in the parent of this directory for insructions on how to
build and install wolfSSL on your linux machine with ML-DSA (Dilithium) support.
It will be required to build the applications on the linux side that will talk
to the STM32 board over UART.

## Building the Applications for the Linux Side

```
$ make
```

## Configuring the STM32CubeIDE Project

Please see the following video for highlights on how to configure wolfSSL to
enable our PQM4 integration.

Detailed instructions on how to build a project with wolfssl can be found at:

https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/tree/master/IDE/STM32Cube

1. Follow instructions at the link above and make sure you can perform "Example
   for TLS v1.3 over UART".
2. Run the `setup_kyber.sh` script in this directory. It will clone relevant
   git repos from github and generate the directories and files you need.
3. Drag and drop the include files into `Inc` and the `pqm4_kyber512` directory
   into `Core`.
4. Turn on the PQM4 integration.
   - Open the .ioc file
   - Click "Software Packs"
   - Click on the wolfSSL.I-CUBE-wolfSSL.<version> that appears.
   - In the Configuration box that appears, set "PQM4 Post-Quantum Integration
     Support" to "True"
   - Close the .ioc file and generate code.
   - Build your project.

For your reference, `wolfssl_stm32_pq` is a minimal starting project that has
many things already configured. If you have a NUCLEO-F446ZE evaluation board
Then you can skip step 1 and 4 and just use that.

Once you have successfully built and flashed the project, the STM32 terminal
should should display the following menu:

```
                                MENU

        t. wolfCrypt Test
        b. wolfCrypt Benchmark
        l. wolfSSL TLS Bench
        e. Show Cipher List
        s. Run TLS 1.3 Server over UART
        c. Run TLS 1.3 Client over UART
Please select one of the above options:
```

## Benchmarks to Compare Against Conventional Algorithms

On the STM32 console terminal, press the b key to run the benchmarks.

Here is some sample output taken on a NUCLEO-F446ZE at 168MHz using SP Math
with Assembly Optimizations:

## Quantum safe TLS 1.3 Connection Over UART (Linux server, STM32 client)

You will need to use sudo as the USB serial device requires root access.
In a terminal, execute the server:

```sh
$ sudo ./server-tls-uart
```

On the STM32 console terminal, press the c key to run the client.

## Quantum safe TLS 1.3 Connection Over UART (STM32 server, Linux client)

On the STM32 console terminal, press the s key to run the server. This will put
the STM32 board into an infinite loop waiting for a client to connect over UART.
If you pressed the s key by accident, simply reset the board to bring yourself
back to the menu prompt.

You will need to use sudo as the USB serial device requires root access.
In your Linux terminal, execute the client:

```sh
$ sudo ./client-tls-uart
```

## Expected Output

The server should have the following output:

```
Running TLS 1.3 server...
Waiting for client
TLS Accept handshake done
Read (0): Testing 1, 2 and 3

Sent (0): Testing 1, 2 and 3
```

The client should have the following output:

```
Using quantum-safe KYBER_LEVEL1.
TLS Connect handshake done
Sending test string
Sent (0): Testing 1, 2 and 3

Read (0): Testing 1, 2 and 3
```
